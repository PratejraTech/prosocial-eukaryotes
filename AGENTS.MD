## Developed To-Dos

1. Hypotheses: [List H1-H5 as above]. Test via simulations/experiments.

2. BMAD Requirements: [Software/instructions as above]. Three variants for validation.

3. Case Studies: [Three as above].

4. Researchers: [19th/20th as above].

Framework: PILAR for issue navigation; promote egalitarian/prosocial.

### LIST OF TO DOS
1. EVALUATE THE ABSTRACTS INCLUDED, AND RESEARCH PAPERS AND DEVELOP A RIGOROUS SET OF HYPOTHESES TO BE TESTED BY A DEEP RESEARCH AGENT
2. USE THE BMAD METHOD TO PRODUCE A SET OF REQUIREMENTS FOR A COLLABORATIVE SOFTWARE OR SIMPLE OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPTIMISING COLLABORATION IN COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS
3. DEVELOP THREE CASE STUDIES BASED ON RESEARCH WHICH ARE COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS
4. DRAW IN OTHER PRE-EMININET RESEARCHERS ON PRO-SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT FROM THE 19th and 20th CENTURY
5. STICK TO THE BMAD METHOD
6. ASSUME YOU ARE INCORRECT UNTIL ARRIVING AT A LOGICALLY SOUND CONCLUSION. ALWAYS HAVE THREE AND USE THE FILE SYSTEM. DEVELOP THE TODO's TO BE SAVED IN AGENTS.MD
