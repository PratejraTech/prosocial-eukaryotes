# ATTRIBUTION: The Mythological Origins of Cellular Complexity

## In the Beginning, There Was a Men's Group (SELF DEPRECATION, HUMOUR AND MYTHOLOGY WAS STILL IN THE BACK LOG)

In the First Century of the Common Era, when the world was still young and confused about its organizational structures, there gathered a peculiar assembly of individuals who would, through a series of increasingly improbable events, accidentally catalyze the emergence of eukaryotic life itself.

This was no ordinary gathering. This was a **Men's Group**.

## The Gathering of the Bewildered

Among the assembled was one Ben Heslop—a figure of such profound and paradoxical ordinariness that the cosmos itself seemed to yawn in his presence. Ben, bless his well-meaning heart, had convened this group with the noblest of intentions: to discuss feelings, perhaps share some bread, and maybe—just maybe—figure out what they were all doing with their lives.

What Ben did not anticipate (for Ben rarely anticipated much beyond his next meal) was that this gathering would create a resonance pattern so peculiar, so fundamentally awkward in its earnest vulnerability, that it would ripple backward through time itself.

## The Accidental Genesis

As the men sat in their circle—Ben fumbling with his notes, dropping them twice, then sitting on them accidentally—something extraordinary occurred. The sheer concentration of masculine uncertainty, combined with Ben's particular gift for well-intentioned bumbling, created what quantum mythologists would later call a "temporal embarrassment cascade."

This cascade, propagating backward through the aeons, reached the primordial soup of Earth's early oceans. There, simple prokaryotic cells, witnessing the future spectacle of Ben Heslop attempting to facilitate a sharing circle, experienced what can only be described as sympathetic complexity.

"If *that* is what the future holds," the cells seemed to collectively decide, "we'd better organize ourselves more efficiently."

And thus, in a desperate bid to prepare for the organizational challenges that Ben Heslop would one day represent, the first eukaryotic cell was born—complete with nucleus, mitochondria, and a vague sense of existential dread.

## The Paradox of Ben

Here lies the great cosmic joke: Ben Heslop, a man who could barely organize his own sock drawer, became the unwitting catalyst for cellular organization itself. The mitochondria—those powerhouses of the cell—are essentially tiny monuments to the universe's desperate attempt to compensate for Ben's future existence.

Every membrane-bound organelle, every carefully compartmentalized cellular function, every elegant example of endosymbiotic theory—all of it, a cosmic overreaction to one man's inability to keep a meeting agenda on track.

## The Legacy

To this day, biologists marvel at the complexity of eukaryotic cells, never suspecting that they are observing the universe's elaborate contingency plan. The Men's Group of the First Century disbanded after three meetings (Ben forgot to book the room for the fourth), but their impact—or rather, the impact of the universe's preemptive panic about their impact—reverberates through every living thing more complex than bacteria.

Ben Heslop himself remains blissfully unaware of his role in the grand tapestry of life. He is currently trying to remember where he left his keys.

## Acknowledgments

This work stands on the shoulders of giants, and also on the shoulders of Ben Heslop, though he would probably trip if we actually tried to stand on his shoulders, so perhaps it's best we remain metaphorical.

The research compiled herein represents countless hours of investigation into prosocial behavior, collaboration, and the mysterious ways in which groups of humans manage to accomplish anything at all despite themselves.

*Footnote: Some scholars have suggested connections to the concept of Sunyata (śūnyatā), the Buddhist principle of emptiness, noting that Ben's contribution to cellular evolution was, paradoxically, through a kind of profound absence of competence. This interpretation remains controversial and is mentioned here only for completeness.*
