# LEGAL MEMORANDUM

**RE:** The Matter of Sunyata (Alleged Mythical Machine) and Associated Liabilities  
**DATE:** [REDACTED]  
**FROM:** The Law Offices of Cautious, Wary & Nope  
**TO:** All Partners, Associates, and Anyone Foolish Enough to Ask  
**SUBJECT:** Our Firm's Position on Representation Regarding the So-Called "Sunyata Device"

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
[REDACTED]
After careful consideration, extensive research, and several partners literally backing away from the conference table, this firm **DECLINES** to provide legal counsel, representation, or even casual commentary regarding the mythical apparatus known as "Sunyata," allegedly invented during the 3.1415th through 42nd Day of the McDonald's Corporation's existence (hereinafter referred to as "The Irrational Period").

## STATEMENT OF RETICENCE

Be it known that the undersigned counsel, having reviewed the preliminary materials concerning this matter, hereby states for the record that we **will not touch that shit with a 10-foot pole**, nor with any pole of any length, material, or jurisdiction.

## GROUNDS FOR DECLINATION

### I. PRECEDENTIAL CONCERNS

The legal community has not forgotten the Great Sweet and Sour Sauce Litigation of [REDACTED], wherein contemplative practices—specifically, prolonged wall-staring—resulted in a class action lawsuit of unprecedented scope. The Court's finding that "meditative emptiness may constitute an attractive nuisance when conducted in proximity to condiment dispensers" remains binding precedent in seventeen jurisdictions.

### II. TEMPORAL IMPOSSIBILITY

The alleged invention date (Days 3.1415th through 42nd of McDonald's existence) presents insurmountable evidentiary challenges:

a) The fractional day designation suggests either:
   - A fundamental misunderstanding of temporal mechanics, or
   - The involvement of π, which this firm has learned to avoid after the Circular Reasoning v. Square Meal debacle of 1987

b) The span from an irrational number to the "Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything" creates what our senior partner describes as "a jurisdictional nightmare wrapped in a mathematical enigma, deep-fried in cosmic absurdity"

### III. THE SUNYATA PROBLEM

The device's alleged function—to embody the Buddhist concept of emptiness—presents unique liability exposure:

- **Product Liability:** How does one sue emptiness?
- **Breach of Warranty:** What warranties attach to nothing?
- **Negligence:** Can void be negligent?
- **Damages:** Calculating damages for absence itself may violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics

### IV. THE MCDONALD'S FACTOR

Any legal matter intersecting with:
- Fast food corporations
- Sauce-related disputes
- Wall-staring incidents
- Metaphysical machinery

...has historically resulted in discovery requests that would make Kafka weep.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Our actuarial consultants have determined that the risk profile of this matter exceeds "Absolutely Not" and approaches "Are You Kidding Me Right Now?"

Specific concerns include:

1. **The Wall-Staring Precedent:** Any case involving contemplative practices near food service establishments carries inherent class action risk. The Sweet and Sour Sauce Plaintiffs' Bar remains active and well-funded.

2. **Metaphysical Jurisdiction:** Which court has jurisdiction over a machine that embodies emptiness? The Void? The Ninth Circuit? (Same thing, some would argue.)

3. **Expert Witnesses:** Finding qualified experts to testify about a mythical machine from an impossible time period would require either:
   - Theoretical physicists (expensive)
   - Zen masters (inscrutable)
   - McDonald's historians (terrifying)

## CONCLUSION

This firm respectfully but emphatically **DECLINES** any and all involvement with the Sunyata matter. We recommend that any party seeking legal counsel regarding this device:

- Consult with philosophers (they work cheaper)
- Consider meditation (it's what started this mess)
- Accept that some things are better left unlitigated

## DISCLAIMER

This memorandum does not constitute legal advice, as we are not advising anyone to do anything except stay far away from this entire situation. Any resemblance to actual legal reasoning is purely coincidental and possibly illusory—much like Sunyata itself.

Furthermore, this firm notes that even *writing* this memorandum has resulted in three associates staring at the office walls for extended periods. We are monitoring the situation for sauce-related developments.
