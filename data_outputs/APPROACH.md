Below is a Python script designed to generate 3000 synthetic question-and-answer pairs compatible with the fine-tuned Microsoft Phi-4-14B model using Unsloth. The script captures the core themes, bases questions on hypotheses, incorporates commonly referenced theories, and emulates the authors' style, tone, and opinions as derived from the provided documents. The output is formatted as a `.jsonl` file suitable for fine-tuning, with each entry including `question`, `answer`, `source`, and `timestamp`.

### Approach
1. **Core Themes**: Identified from the documents (e.g., PILAR model, prosocial evolution, inequality aversion, Thorngate’s Postulate, Deep Research Agent).
2. **Hypotheses-Based Questions**: Derived from the five hypotheses in `hypothese1.md` (H1-H5), expanded with variations to cover all 3000 pairs.
3. **Commonly Referenced Theories**: Includes social identity theory (SIT), social network analysis (SNA), psychological safety, field theory (Lewin), cognitive dissonance (Festinger), and inequity aversion (de Waal).
4. **Authors' Style, Tone, and Opinions**: The authors (Heslop et al.) adopt a scholarly yet accessible tone, blending empirical rigor with evolutionary optimism. They advocate for PILAR’s potential to unify SGP theories, emphasize idealized collaboration, and express cautious optimism about AI-driven solutions like DRA, while acknowledging complexity challenges.

            "Egalitarian behavior and cultural transformation": "Egalitarian behavior stabilizes groups via the communication-respect-liking trio, yet may stifle Agency, a tension we believe can be balanced with careful design.",

            "Psychological Safety": "Psychological safety fosters Agency, a pillar we deem critical for innovation within PILAR.",

```

### Explanation
1. **Core Themes**: The seven themes reflect the documents' focus, guiding question diversity.
2. **Hypotheses-Based Questions**: Each question ties to one of the five hypotheses, ensuring alignment with the authors' research agenda.
3. **Commonly Referenced Theories**: Six theories are cycled to provide theoretical grounding, mirroring the documents' citations.
4. **Authors' Style, Tone, and Opinions**:
   - **Style**: Questions use formal phrasing (e.g., "To what extent..."), and answers blend empirical evidence with speculative optimism.
   - **Tone**: Scholarly yet accessible, with phrases like "we contend" and "further empirical testing is prudent."
   - **Opinions**: Emphasis on PILAR’s potential, cautious acknowledgment of complexity (Thorngate’s Postulate), and advocacy for DRA as a solution.

### Output Format
The `.jsonl` file (`synthetic_qa_phi4.jsonl`) contains 3000 lines, each a JSON object:
- `question`: A unique ID (Q1-Q3000) followed by a hypothesis-driven question.
- `answer`: A response reflecting the authors' style, integrating themes and theories.
- `source`: Rotates through the five documents.
- `timestamp`: Set to 12:13 PM UTC (11:13 PM ACDT) on October 20, 2025.

### Compatibility with Phi-4-14B and Unsloth
- The format aligns with Unsloth’s fine-tuning requirements for Phi-4-14B, using plain text JSONL without nested structures.
- Questions and answers are concise yet rich, suitable for the model’s context window and fine-tuning efficiency.
- The dataset size (3000 pairs) provides ample data for training, with diversity to enhance generalization.
