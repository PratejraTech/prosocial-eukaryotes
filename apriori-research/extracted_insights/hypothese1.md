Key Themes The documents synthesize evolutionary psychology, sociobiology, and social/group psychology (SGP) to model prosocial, positive-sum collaboration as a means to foster fairer, more adaptive organizations and societies. Central themes include:

Prosocial Evolution: Prosocial behaviors in nonhuman animals (e.g., primates like chimpanzees, capuchin monkeys, and bonobos) facilitated by psychological factors such as inequity aversion, interdependence, and tolerance. In humans, sub-group level selection (sGLS) explains divergence from the last common ancestor (LCA) with Pan, leveraging behavioral dimorphism (agonic vs. hedonic modes) and savannah ecology for exponential prosocial advantages, including fairness preferences, compassion, and small-team coordination.

Positive-Sum vs. Zero-Sum Behaviors: Collaboration yields synergies through trust-based relationships, undermined by zero-sum actions (e.g., free-riding, undue credit-seeking). Positive-sum perspectives build collaborative ability (CA) via win-win outcomes, ancestral norms, and explicit guidelines to counter unpredictability and intangible benefits.
Collaboration Models: EUCRM (Encapsulated Unified Collaboration Research Model, 2016) with components (confidence, respect, communication, liking, performance) and impacts (attracting/opposing forces, feedback loops). Evolved into PILAR (Prospects, Involved, Liked, Agency, Respect, 2019), encapsulating >30 SGP theories with 20 forces (14 positive, 6 negative) between pillars, aligned to theories like social identity theory (SIT), social network analysis (SNA), and psychological safety. Models assume idealized collaboration (voluntary, egalitarian start) for viability assessment.
Cultural Transformation: Shift from domination (hierarchical, psychopathy-reinforcing) to partnership systems (egalitarian, prosocial) via Human Possibilities Theory (HPT) at macro level, complemented by micro-level EUCRM/PILAR. Addresses Thorngate's postulate (general, accurate, simple theories impossible) by combining macro-micro for practical guidelines.
Learning and Engagement: Self-interested (proself, low prosociality) learners avoid prosocial content; higher quality of life (QoL) correlates with engagement, suggesting interventions target reticence.
Influence of Egalitarian Behavior Egalitarian structures promote mutual respect, liking, and communication (positive reinforcing feedback trio in EUCRM), fostering trust, peer-to-peer coordination, and prosociality (e.g., bonobos' high tolerance/prosocial to strangers). In HPT, prehistoric egalitarianism (partnership system) suppressed psychopathy, enabled by shallow hierarchies reducing confidence but enhancing collective norms via peer pressure (tragedy of the commons avoidance). In PILAR, egalitarianism aligns with Involved/Liked perceptions, encouraging conformity and warmth, but limits Agency (innovation). Evidence from remnant hunter-gatherers and neuroscience (fairness preference) shows egalitarianism stabilizes groups but may cause violence/frustration from unvoiced suggestions (low confidence). Balanced with hierarchy (actualization hierarchies) for innovation while maintaining trio.
Inequality Aversion Facilitates convergent evolution of prosocial behaviors by punishing unfair outcomes (e.g., primates reject unequal rewards, influenced by begging). In humans, aversion to inequity (e.g., game theory punishment despite cost) promotes fairness, compassion, and coordination, differentiating hominins via sGLS. Links to Respect pillar (trust in KSAs) and zero-sum avoidance; low aversion enables domination systems (wealth inequality). Interventions teaching models leverage aversion to build CA.
4-7. Own Interpretation of Key Words (Derived from Synthesis)
4. Pillar Perceptions: Subjective, single-sided assessments (e.g., one's view of colleague's Prospects/Involved) enabling quick viability detection; interdependent for reliability, evolving from tribal risk assessment.
5. Dynamic Forces/Impacts: Paired positive/negative influences between components (e.g., Prospects → Agency negative in success paradox); predict reactions, guide behavior (e.g., strategy change sequence).
6. Feedback Loops: Positive reinforcing (trio: communication/respect/liking for partnership stability); negative reinforcing (confidence/respect opposition for innovation vs. health balance); explain system persistence/shifts.
7. Collaborative Viability: Emergent from idealized preconditions and forces; teachable via models to counter zero-sum, promote prosocial in complex environments.

1. Rigorous Set of Hypotheses for Deep Research Agent Testing
These hypotheses integrate evolutionary facilitators, models, and empirical gaps. Test via agent-based simulations (e.g., networkx for forces), field experiments (pre/post PILAR training), or literature meta-analysis (e.g., prosocial in primates/humans). Assume null until evidence; prioritize multi-method validation (e.g., QoL/EQ correlations).

H1: Teaching PILAR/EUCRM increases prosocial orientation (e.g., reduced zero-sum actions) and group viability, mediated by pillar awareness; stronger in low-empathy individuals (test: RCT with SCARF comparison, measure CA via peer-assessment).
H2: High inequality aversion predicts elevated Respect/Involved perceptions and prosocial engagement, moderating zero-sum avoidance (test: primate-inspired ultimatum games in teams; correlate with sGLS proxies like subgroup competition).
H3: Egalitarian structures boost liking/respect/communication (trio feedback) but reduce agency/confidence, leading to stable yet less adaptive groups in savannah-like (resource-scarce) ecologies (test: simulate dimorphism in Pan/hominin models; organizational case studies).
H4: Low prosociality (e.g., low QoL/EQ) causes reticence in prosocial learning, requiring ancestral norm priming (e.g., "adaptive" phrasing) for engagement (test: extend self-learners study; A/B test interventions).
H5: Hierarchy steepness balances confidence/performance (innovation) vs. trio (health); optimal in actualization hierarchies (test: EUCRM impacts in healthcare teams; feedback loop modeling).
Deep agent: Search primate studies (de Waal), SGP meta-analyses (e.g., SIT/SNA alignment), simulate forces (PuLP for constraints); chronological review of Heslop iterations (EUCRM→PILAR).

2. BMAD Method for Requirements
Interpreting BMAD as Breakdown (analyze issues into components), Model (map interactions/forces), Apply (prosocial principles), Design (interventions/guidelines) – a iterative, assumption-critical method (assume incorrect; validate with three perspectives: evolutionary, psychological, organizational). Always consider three options/scenarios for robustness. Applied to formalize structured implementation (software or instructions) optimizing collaboration in complex environments (e.g., unpredictable change, hierarchy tensions).

Breakdown: Decompose issues into PILAR/EUCRM components (e.g., low performance → confidence drop).
Model: Map forces/impacts/feedback (e.g., strategy change sequence; trio reinforcement).
Apply: Infuse prosocial (egalitarian, aversion to inequality, tolerance) to counter zero-sum.
Design: Output requirements; test three variants (minimal, moderated, simulated).

Requirements for Collaborative Software (App/Tool):

Core: User rates pillars (1-10 scale); visualizes forces/feedback (e.g., graph with attracting/opposing arrows). Three views: individual (self-ratings), team (aggregated), simulated (what-if scenarios).
Functionality: Predict viability (e.g., emergent states via constraints); suggest actions (e.g., boost communication if low trio). Integrate ancestral norms (tooltips: "Primate tolerance promotes Involved").
Optimization: Hierarchy slider balances confidence vs. trio; alerts for negative feedback (e.g., impending failure). Three modes: diagnostic (breakdown), predictive (model), prescriptive (apply/design guidelines).
Usability: Mobile/web; anonymous peer input; export reports. Validate with QoL/EQ pre/post use.
Simple Operation Instructions for Complex Environments:

Breakdown: Assess pillars (e.g., survey: "Perceive group Prospects high?"). Identify imbalances (three checks: self, peer, external threat).
Model: Trace impacts (e.g., low performance → suggest change via confidence ↑ communication). Simulate three outcomes (best/worst/likely).
Apply: Promote egalitarian prosocial (e.g., punish inequity; encourage tolerance to strangers).
Design: Act on forces (e.g., flatten hierarchy for respect; delegate for agency). Review feedback loops; iterate.
Three scenarios: Crisis (opposing impacts dominate; prioritize trio stability), Innovation (boost agency; accept respect dip), Steady-state (maintain balance).

3. Three Case Studies Based on Research (Complex Environments)
Case 1: Primate Troops in Savannah Ecology (Evolutionary Complexity)
Behavioral dimorphism in Pan (chimpanzees: agonic/hierarchical for defense; bonobos: hedonic/egalitarian for dispersed resources) under savannah pressures enabled sGLS. Inequality aversion punished unfairness; tolerance/interdependence fostered prosocial to strangers. Outcome: Hominin divergence with unique coordination/compassion. Apply PILAR: Low Prospects (threat) → Agency (innovation) via forces; egalitarian shifts boost Involved/Liked.

Case 2: Healthcare Research Teams (Organizational Complexity)
In Mothers and Babies Research Centre (authors' context), interdisciplinary teams face hierarchy (experts) vs. innovation needs. EUCRM/PILAR diagnoses: Steep hierarchy → high confidence/performance but low respect (tragedy of commons in resource allocation). Intervention: Teach model; flatten for trio feedback, aversive to inequity in credit-sharing. Outcome: Improved CA, reduced psychopathy via secondary prevention; balanced actualization hierarchies.

Case 3: Online Prosocial Learning Platforms (Modern Digital Complexity)
Self-learners study: EUCRM taught via website; low prosocial (low QoL) disengage early (front matter only), high QoL reach learning. Complexity: Unpredictable engagement; zero-sum reticence. Apply: Prime ancestral norms ("adaptive" phrasing); three-stage progression with QoL/EQ checks. Outcome: Higher engagement in prosocial; suggests targeted priming for self-interested.
