Abstract
Prosocial behaviors have long been considered a hallmark of humans. However, observational and experimental studies have revealed that nonhuman animals also show a variety of prosocial behaviors, but the likely evolutionary path of prosocial behaviors has remained unclear. In this chapter, I hypothesize that some psychological factors, namely, inequity aversion, interdependence and tolerance, may have played facilitating roles in the convergent evolution of prosocial behaviors. In experimental studies, some primates who show inequity aversion, such as chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys, have also shown robust prosocial behaviors, although the partnerâ€™s begging behaviors may be influential. Proactive prosocial behaviors occur in cooperative breeder primates with high levels of allomaternal care, who also show high levels of interdependence. High levels of tolerance and prosocial behaviors toward partners including strangers have been reported particularly in bonobos. I also discuss how the convergent evolution hypotheses of prosocial behaviors applies not only to primates but also non-primate species, by reviewing recent experimental studies on birds and domestic animals. Finally, I propose some possible future study directions for extending explorations of the evolutionary route of prosocial behaviors.

Abstract 2:
A perennial challenge of evolutionary psychology is explaining prosocial traits such as a preference for fairness rather than inequality, compassion towards suffering, and an instinctive ability to coordinate within small teams. Considering recent fossil evidence and a novel logical test, we deem present explanations insufficiently explanatory of the divergence of hominins. In answering this question, we focus on the divergence of hominins from the last common ancestor (LCA) shared with Pan. We consider recent fossil discoveries that indicate the LCA was bipedal, which reduces the cogency of this explanation for hominin development. We also review evolutionary theory that claims to explain how hominins developed into modern humans, however it is found that no mechanism differentiates hominins from other primates. Either the mechanism was available to the last common ancestor (LCA) (with P. troglodytes as its proxy), or because early hominins had insufficient cognition to utilise the mechanism. A novel mechanism, sub-group level selection (sGLS) is hypothesised by triangulating two pieces of data rarely considered by evolutionary biologists. These are behavioural dimorphism of Pan (chimpanzees and bonobos) that remain identifiable in modern humans, and the social behaviour of primate troops in a savannah ecology. We then contend that sGLS supplied an exponential effect which was available to LCA who left the forest, but was not sufficiently available to any other primates. In conclusion, while only indirectly supported by various evidence, sGLS is found to be singularly and persuasively explanatory of human's unique evolutionary story.
